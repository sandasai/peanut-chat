- *Delay* - Postpones any recieved messages to display X seconds later. For example if delay is set to 30, messages that were sent 30 seconds ago will begin to show.
- *Rating System* - Click thumbs up / down to rate messages. 
- *Add Messaging and Rating timeout?* - This adds a timeout system which allows users to send/rate messages every couple of seconds. As you level up with ratings, the timeout length decreases.
